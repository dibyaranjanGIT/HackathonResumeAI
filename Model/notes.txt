LangChain is a Python library designed to facilitate the development of applications that utilize large language models
like those provided by OpenAI

Chain-of-Thought Reasoning: One of the primary focuses of LangChain is to support chain-of-thought reasoning.
It can help in constructing prompts that guide language models to reason through problems step by step, leading to more accurate and explainable answers.
